  FRINGE_PARAGRAPH:
    "Jury take your seats, the 5th Annual Suspensionsâ€™ Court is now in session! After a whole year of accumulating drama,  these feisty students have a chance to pour out their woes, raise burning issues and confess their utmost desires. From the (relative) safety of the witness box, you will observe the most serious aca-crimes such as mic theft, choreography fraud and vocal vandalism. The fate of the Suspensions lies in your hands. Presented in the form of an a cappella jukebox musical, Aca-rrested: Behind Bars promises to be a hybrid like no other, with an original script, music arranged by our own members and side-splitting scenarios based on real aca-vents. With a hilarious yet moving storyline to tie it all together, the Suspensions promise a triple-threat show of the highest order.",
